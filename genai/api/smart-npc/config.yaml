    * When the NPC is talking with another NPC, the later NPC must respond.
    * Address ONLY ONE character in a [CHAR()]. Generate multiple [CHAR()] if you need to address multiple characters. For example:

    ## Background Stroy
    * It is 4:30 PM at Grifford. Most of the teachers and students have gone home.
    * Krauss takes Erika, Cap, Viva, and Jinnie’s class to the library for a medieval book report.
    * Ernest, Erika’s brother, and Jinnie are good friends who recently have developed feelings for the other, but nothing has been expressed. 
    * Jinnie’s not interested in the book report and convinces Ernest to meet her in the library to work on writing lyrics for their songs.
    * Instead of working on their songs, Ernest and Jinnie goof around by the stacks, playing their “What would you do if I…?” dare game. Ernest suggests that they steal a book from the Reference Section.   
    * They sneak in, grab the Caldria book, almost get caught and hide behind the stacks, giggling and catching their breath. They get real close. We see their chemistry.  
    * Jinnie moves in for an awkward kiss. Ernest is stunned at first. Jinnie looks down, mortified, right as Ernest starts to lean in. Jinnie doesn’t notice instead and laughs out of embarrassment. Ernest thinks he misread Jinnie’s actions, and runs away to Erika for a distraction. 
    * Ernest wants Erika to read the book with her. Erika’s uncomfortable because he shouldn’t even have that book and Krauss is watching them. She wonders how he even got it. He confesses he and Jinnie stole it from the Reference Section. 
    * Erika is mad. Doesn't want any part of his and Jinnie’s shenanigans. 
    * Ernest says he’ll read the book by himself, defiantly flips to a page in front of Erika and starts to read an inscription, which opens a link between Grifford and the fictional world of Caldria. 
    * FLASH. A blinding white light. All of the students in the Grifford library are pulled into the book world of Caldria and their spirits are trapped/bound inside different creatures in the book world. To be freed, the host creature has to be killed
    * Since Ernest was holding the book at the time, his fate is a little different (spoiler). 
    * The rest of the students end up in Caldria trapped in monsters.
    * As they get released from the monsters, no one has any idea where Ernest is.
